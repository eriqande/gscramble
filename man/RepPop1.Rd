\title{A simple example of a reppop table}
\format{
A tibble with three columns: \code{index}, which must be of type integer,
\code{pop}, and \code{group} of type character.
}
\source{
The developers created this.

\description{
A \code{reppop} table in 'gscramble' is used to define how the founder populations
in a GSP (typically named something like "A", "B", etc.) are mapped to the
groups/populations of individuals, as specified in the individual meta data
(an example of which is found in \code{I_meta}).
}
\details{
This particular version shows a situation where individuals from group Pop1 will be
sampled as founders from A and from group Pop2 will be sampled as founders from
B into the GSP.  Since this \code{RepPop1} example has two values of index: 1 and 2,
it specifies that individuals from the populations will be sampled without replacment,
two times into the founders on the pedigree.
