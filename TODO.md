## TODO


### Coding stuff

- [ ] `check_chrom_lengths()` function (see tutorial vignette line 162)
- [ ] A Function to check the validity of the GSPs.


### In the paper

- [ ] A concise mathematical description of the components of a GSP, and the constraints between them.


### For thinking

- [ ] Can we come up with a framework for specifying the GSP from requests by the
      user for the desired end results (i.e. number of individuals of different hybrid categories.
      We should be able to figure this out given the constraints.
