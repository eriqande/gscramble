    These are functions that are intended for use by the user when
    preparing inputs for a gscramble simulation and for conducting those
    simulation.

- title: "Functions for summarizing and visualizing simulation results or inputs"
  desc: >
    These are just a few functions to summarize the results from
    gscramble simulations or to visualize GSPs.
- contents:
  - computeQs_from_segments
  - plot_simulated_chromomsome_segments
  - gsp2dot
- title: "Data input and output functions"
  desc: >
    These functions help to get data in PLINK format into
    gscramble, and also converting gscramble objects into
    PLINK files.

- title: "Example data objects"
  desc: >
    These data objects are provided as examples of the inputs to gscramble.
    They are used in the vignettes as well.

    These are functions that are not intended for use by the general
    user, but they are included in the documentation for the interest of
    developers and they are exported in the package to help with debugging and
    development.
