## TODO


### Coding stuff

- [ ] `check_chrom_lengths()` function (see tutorial vignette line 162)
- [ ] A Function to check the validity of the GSPs.
- [ ] Figure out if recombination rates between adjacent markers will work within the existing framework.
- [ ] Check out `xover()` and deal with what happens when a new breakpoint occurs exactly
at an existing one, and be explicit in the documentation about whether breaks occur
"to the left" or "to the right" of the breakpoint.  


### In the paper

- [ ] A concise mathematical description of the components of a GSP, and the constraints between them.


### For thinking

- [ ] Can we come up with a framework for specifying the GSP from requests by the
      user for the desired end results (i.e. number of individuals of different hybrid categories.
      We should be able to figure this out given the constraints.
